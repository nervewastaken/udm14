# &udm=14 Website

This was a ease of use project for me so I could make &udm=14 look more like my normal home page, its just for fun you can implement this too in your own way 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nervewastaken/udm14.git
```
you can change wallpapers using basic html 
change icon by renaming your icon image to favicon and replacing it in the folder, 
use live server if you want an instance running 
or deploy to vercel or some other free hosting platform to connect it on startup
